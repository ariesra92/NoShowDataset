## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
 
In addition to the Anaconda distribution of Python, xgboost library is necessary for predictions, graphviz and plotly is for visulation. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
 
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
 
Following the questions asked when conducting the analysis:
 
1. Determining what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
2. Is age range associated with the show up rate?
3. Which gender is more likely to show up for their appointments?
4. Are hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap or receiving SMS related to the likelihood of patients showing up?
5. Is is it possible to predict whether a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
 
 
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
 
There are 1 notebook aand 1 csv file available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory and predictive data analysis parts. csv file is the cleaned version of the dataset.
 
## Results<a name="results"></a>
 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@esraar_92055/are-you-gonna-attend-your-medical-appointment-if-not-who-is-to-blame-for-this-5be9fdc3e0d4).
